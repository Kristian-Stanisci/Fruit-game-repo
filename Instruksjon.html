                Welcome to Fruity Catch 2025! The objective of the game is to catch as many falling fruits as possible using your basket. 
                Use the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard to move the basket. 
                The game has three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. 
                Select your preferred difficulty level before starting the game. 
                As you catch fruits, your score will increase. 
                Be careful, as the falling speed of the fruits will increase as you score more points. 
                Try to catch all the fruits and achieve the highest score possible. Good luck!

                This game has been brought to you by Kristian Stanisci. Enjoy playing Fruity Catcher 2025!
